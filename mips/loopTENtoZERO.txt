#Sample program that loops from 10 down to 0
ADDI $s0, $zero, 10 #set s0 to 10
ADDI $s1, $zero, 1  #use to decrement counter, $s0
AGAIN: SUB $s0, $s0, $s1
BEQ $s0, $zero, DONE
J AGAIN
DONE:  #To break out of the loop


Here's a translation of the code into pseudocode:
Set $s0 to 10.
Set $s1 to 1.
Subtract $s1 from $s0 and store result in $s0 (i.e. $s0 = $s0 - $s1).
If $s0 equals 0, go to line 6.
Else, go back to Line 3 and repeat.
Program ends here.
