"""

range(stop): if you have only a single number in the parenthesis, 
it will generate all the numbers from 0 to stop-1. For example, range(5) 
generates the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.


range(start, stop): if you have only two numbers in the parenthesis, 
it will generate all the numbers from start to stop-1. 
For example, range(65,70) generates the numbers 65, 66, 67, 68, 690 .


range(start, stop, step): if you have three numbers in the parenthesis, 
it will generate all the numbers from start to stop-1, increasing by step each time. 
For example, range(100,200,10) generates the numbers 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190.
